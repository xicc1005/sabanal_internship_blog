            <p class="text-lg font-pop font-[300] mr-20 mb-10">I respectfully extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to everyone who did everything they could to make my On-The-Job-Training possible for me.</p>
            <p class="text-lg font-pop font-[300] mr-20 mb-10">I want to start by giving thanks to the Almighty God for His unwavering love and the blessings He gives to me every day of my life. I give Him praise and thanksgiving for helping me throughout my On-The-Job-Training and for making this training achievable. In his provision, He has kept me and my family safe at all times, particularly during my travels between home and work. My gratitude goes out to Him for providing me with the knowledge and skills to complete every task I have been given and for all the challenges I have faced that have made me stronger than ever. It is His comfort that keeps me going when I think of giving up. It was only through His grace that I was able to complete this training without any problems.</p>

            <p class="text-lg font-pop font-[300] mr-20 mb-10">To our College Dean, Dr. Born Christian A. Isip, to our OJT Instructor, Josephine L. Bulilan, MIT to our OJT supervisor PEMS Jose Bobby F Salinas, and to the rest of the CITE faculty, I am very grateful for having them as part of my training. For all of their advices, insights, and recommendations, for anything and everything they taught me throughout my training, and most importantly for all the memories we all have shared together - the blissful days, stressful days, as well as for everything they did to help me become a better person. I am very truly grateful to them.</p>

            <li class="font-pop font-normal text-sm mb-10">INTRODUCTION</li>
            <p class="text-lg font-pop font-[300] mr-20 mb-10">A typical college program includes on-the-job training, which aims to educate students about the working world and potential career paths. This form of skill development allows individuals to gain practical experience while learning about a specific job role. Through on-the-job training, students are exposed to various work environments, providing them with the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in real work scenarios and enhance their workplace skills and knowledge.</p>
            <p class="text-lg font-pop font-[300] mr-20 mb-10">On-the-job training is essential for educating students about their chosen careers and introducing them to the practical aspects of the professional world. Participants get hands-on experience in tasks related to their academic studies, enabling them to work and learn simultaneously. This training allows students to apply their academic learning practically, further exploring their chosen field and improving their overall proficiency. As trainees become more skilled, they can efficiently complete tasks, enhancing their professionalism and interpersonal abilities in a work setting. Ultimately, this training equips learners to handle work situations, collaborate effectively with colleagues, and make sound decisions.</p>
            <p class="text-lg font-pop font-[300] mr-20 mb-10">Effective on-the-job training is vital for preparing future professionals for their careers, as the knowledge and skills acquired during training can be directly applied in the workplace. Apart from academic learning, students also develop social skills, improving their communication and teamwork capabilities. This training empowers participants to acquire industry-specific skills, engage fully in their chosen field, and adapt to various job roles and personalities within an organization. By working alongside experienced individuals, trainees can learn the correct procedures, interact with individuals at different levels within the organization, and gain insights from industry experts. Dedication and effort are crucial during on-the-job training, as taking the process seriously can significantly impact one's career readiness and serve as a valuable asset when transitioning from student life to a professional career.</p>

            <p class="text-lg font-pop font-[300] mr-20 mb-10">During my on-the-job training, I engaged in various tasks, including diagnosing, 
                troubleshooting, and reformatting computers and laptops, installing software, encoding 
                and scanning documents, and assisting in events such as the 29th Police Community
